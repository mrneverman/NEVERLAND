## WELCOME TO NEVERLAND
Neverland is cluster of islands located in the middle of a tectonic area. Due to the high rate of volcanic activities and earthquakes, each island is prone to instant destruction. Thanks to advanced “as code” technology in here, each of them can born from ashes in a short time.

There is only one motto here: Everything As Code!!

- "The Great Port of Neverland" is the main and only entry point to Neverland. It contains kubectl utility to talk to Nevertown and a firewall to protect cluster habitat from unintended visitors.
- "Nevertown" is the capital of Neverland which governs all activities in cluster.
- "Island of Intelligence"is the observatory of cluster which contains prometheus and other related tools to monitor health and each ongoing activities on islands.
- "Worktown(s)" is where the hardworking residents of Neverland lives.
